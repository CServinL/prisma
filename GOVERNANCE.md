## Project Overview

Prisma is an open-source AI-driven systematic literature review system designed to support academic research through automated literature discovery, analysis, and synthesis. The project aims to make systematic literature reviews more accessible, reproducible, and efficient.

**Mission**: To democratize access to comprehensive literature review capabilities through AI-powered automation while maintaining academic rigor and ethical standards.

**Vision**: To become the standard platform for systematic literature reviews in academic research, supporting evidence-based decision making across all disciplines.

## Governance Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Openness**: All governance processes are transparent and documented
2. **Meritocracy**: Contributions and expertise drive influence, not titles
3. **Consensus**: Seek agreement while maintaining project momentum
4. **Inclusivity**: Welcome diverse perspectives and contributors
5. **Academic Integrity**: Maintain highest standards of research ethics
6. **Sustainability**: Ensure long-term project viability

### Values

- **Quality**: Prioritize robust, reliable, and well-tested code
- **Collaboration**: Foster a supportive and inclusive community
- **Innovation**: Embrace new ideas while maintaining stability
- **Transparency**: Make decisions openly with clear rationale
- **Responsibility**: Consider the impact on the research community

## Decision Making Process

### Decision Categories

#### 1. Day-to-Day Decisions
- **Scope**: Bug fixes, minor features, documentation updates
- **Process**: Individual contributor decision with peer review
- **Timeline**: Immediate to 1 week

#### 2. Significant Changes
- **Scope**: New features, API changes, dependency updates
- **Process**: Maintainer consensus with community input
- **Timeline**: 1-4 weeks discussion period

#### 3. Major Decisions
- **Scope**: Architecture changes, major features, breaking changes
- **Process**: RFC (Request for Comments) process
- **Timeline**: 4-8 weeks discussion and implementation

#### 4. Strategic Decisions
- **Scope**: Project direction, partnerships, licensing
- **Process**: Project lead decision with maintainer input
- **Timeline**: As needed

### RFC Process

For major decisions, we use an RFC (Request for Comments) process:

1. **Draft**: Author creates RFC document
2. **Discussion**: 2-week community discussion period
3. **Revision**: Address feedback and concerns
4. **Decision**: Maintainer team makes final decision
5. **Implementation**: Approved RFCs move to implementation

### Consensus Building

- Seek broad agreement rather than unanimity
- Document dissenting opinions
- Time-bound discussions to maintain momentum
- Escalate to project lead when consensus cannot be reached

## Contribution Process

### Contribution Types

1. **Code Contributions**: Features, bug fixes, performance improvements
2. **Documentation**: User guides, API documentation, tutorials
3. **Testing**: Test cases, performance testing, validation
4. **Research**: Academic validation, methodology improvements
5. **Community**: Support, moderation, outreach

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Issue Creation**: Document need or idea
2. **Discussion**: Community input and refinement
3. **Implementation**: Development with testing
4. **Review**: Code review and quality assurance
5. **Integration**: Merge and release planning

### Quality Standards

- All code must include appropriate tests
- Documentation must be updated for new features
- Security implications must be considered
- Performance impact must be evaluated
- Academic validity must be maintained

## Code Review Process

### Review Requirements

- **All Changes**: Require at least one maintainer review
- **Breaking Changes**: Require multiple maintainer reviews
- **Security Changes**: Require security-focused review

2. **Quality**: Is the code well-written and maintainable?
3. **Testing**: Are appropriate tests included?
4. **Documentation**: Is documentation updated?
5. **Security**: Are there security implications?
6. **Performance**: Is performance impact acceptable?
7. **Academic Validity**: Does it maintain research integrity?

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipeline validation
2. **Peer Review**: Technical review by maintainers
3. **SME Review**: Domain expert review when applicable
